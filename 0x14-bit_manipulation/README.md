# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## Requirements

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files should be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
* You are allowed to use _putchar
* The main.c files  examples you use to test your functions.
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded.

## TASKS
0. Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
 
1. Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

2. Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

3. Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

4. Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

5. Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

6. Write a function that checks the endianness.

7. Find the password for this program.
